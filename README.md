**DESCRIPTION**

This Python script creates an interactive dashboard using Dash to visualize the "ntrarogyaseva.csv" dataset. It loads, cleans, and encodes the data, then generates various interactive plots using Plotly Express (violin, line, pie, scatter, bar, histogram). These plots are integrated into a Dash application, allowing users to explore the data visually through a web interface. The script focuses on data visualization, though it also includes a trained Random Forest Classifier for predicting 'AGE'.

Data Handling: Loads, cleans, and encodes the dataset.

Interactive Plots: Generates various Plotly Express visualizations.

Dash Dashboard: Creates a web-based interactive dashboard.

Visualization Focus: Primarily focuses on data exploration through plots.
